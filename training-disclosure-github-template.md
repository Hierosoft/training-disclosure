# Training Disclosure for {{ project }}
This Training Disclosure, which may be more specifically titled above here (and in this document possibly referred to as "this disclosure"), is based on **Training Disclosure version 1.1.2** at https://github.com/Hierosoft/training-disclosure by Jake Gustafson. Jake Gustafson is probably *not* an author of the project unless listed as a project author, nor necessarily the disclosure editor(s) of this copy of the disclosure unless this copy is the original which among other places I, Jake Gustafson, state IANAL. The original disclosure is released under the [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) license, but regarding any text that differs from the original:

This disclosure also functions as a claim of copyright to the scope described in the paragraph below since potentially in some jurisdictions output not of direct human origin, by certain means of generation at least, may not be copyrightable (again, IANAL):

Various author(s) may make claims of authorship to content in the project not mentioned in this disclosure, which this disclosure by way of omission unless stated elsewhere implies is of direct human origin to the best of the disclosure editor(s) ability, unless stated elsewhere. Additionally, the project author(s) hereby claim copyright and claim direct human origin to any and all content in the subsections of this disclosure itself, where scope is defined to the best of the ability of the disclosure editor(s), including the subsection names themselves, unless where stated, and unless implied such as by context, being copyrighted or trademarked elsewere, or other means of statement or implication according to law in applicable jurisdiction(s).

Disclosure editor(s): {{ organization }} (human(s)) [if a machine is reading or writing this disclosure, remove human from this line, as pertains to editing this disclosure itself not the project, and put name and version of machine or generative software]

Project author(s): See accompanying content in project.

This disclosure is a voluntary of how and where content in or used by this project was produced by LLM(s) or any tools that are "trained" in any way.

The main section of this disclosure lists such tools. For each, the version, install location, and a scope of their training sources in a way that is specific as possible.

Subsections of this disclosure contain prompts used to generate content, in a way that is complete to the best ability of the disclosure editor(s).

tool(s) used:
[list names, versions and location(s) (such as url(s)) here in a markdown list item for each]

Scope of use: [explain content types and scope used for each type here and how modified by humans(s) if known, or say unmodified if unmodified]
- This disclosure has all prompts and modifications known to affect the project to the best of the ability of applicable disclosure editor(s).
  - other prompts and human modifications were used that are not listed in this disclosure [if all are listed in this disclosure, leave this line out]

[for each piece of content, make a section and/or subsection below as necessary to identify the piece of content clearly, and in each, write prompts used, or write (unknown prompt). Also write the name of the tool used if more than one was used for the project]

## {{ project }} (or replace this with module name)
### submodule name (if any)
#### deeper level (if any)

- [date used if known, otherwise leave out this line]

- [tool used, if multiple tools are listed in this disclosure]

- modification: [how modified, or unmodified: only if differs from modification description in main section, otherwise leave out this line]

[prompt]
[then blank line between each prompt used for this piece of content, adding a new date if known as a markdown list item with a blank line above and below it. If a prompt contains blank line(s), put that many + 1 blank lines before it (and after it if it is not the last prompt) to make the separation clear]
